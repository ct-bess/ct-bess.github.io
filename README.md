# My Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

View the live website at: [ct-bess.github.io](https://ct-bess.github.io)

This site is intended to be a lite resume with a blog, some games, and house my running history in one neat little place.

Since this is hosted on Github pages, there are no fun Next.js server side rendering tricks going on. The site is built and then served with static assets.

And please forgive me for any *questionable* CSS styling decisions ...
